Section5.45.css

you can make underline by
.pro {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

Css display properties
block 
inline
inline-block
none

common block display element :
p paragraph
h headers
div divisions
ol ul li list and list items
form form
box that take up the whole width of the screen in the page

common inline display element :
span spans
img images
a anchor
inline only takes up as much space as is need to in height and width nested to box
<span> inline element can be used to edit a part of sentence
you can use span stand anlone to
 <p>an <span class="pro">eng</span>ineer</p>
with inline element you can't change the width of the box
you can change the display value to anything
in css properties {display: inline/block/inline-block/none

inline block :
can change width and able to make box goes to the same line
we consider img for inline block now later maybe change

none:
is dissapiaring the box 

visibility: 
is dissapiaring the box but keeps the original posisition but can't be seen 

<p>hello</p>
<p class="p2">world</p>
<span>hello</span>
<span>world</span>


p {
    background-color: red;

}

.p2 {
    display: none;
}

.p2 {
    visibility: hidden;
}

Section5.47.css

CSS Static and Relative Positioning 
CSS Positioning 
1. Content is Everything 
inline only take up as much width and height as the content 
block eventhough take up 100% width the height is determined by the content 
2. Order Comes From Codes
3. Children Sit On Top of Parents
z dimension determined which element is display first 

Position properties
1. Static Position
2. Relative
it doesn't effect the position of anything else on the screen
if you move the box the original position still there but the box move and doesn't effect anything else
the box can dissapeared
3. Absolute
4. Fixed

Coordinates properties
img{top : 50px;}
top
bottom
left
right

Section5.48.css

absolute positioning 
the chlid box movement absolute to the parent

fixed postioninng
if you scroll the fixed box, the box will stay not scrolled up 

Section5.49.css
the dark art of centering the img with css
the easiest way is the property text-align
the property must be set inside the parent container
text-align work if we have inline or full width block element
block with width set center it with auto value in margin
margin: 0 auto 0 auto;

Section5.50.css

font styling in our personal sites
property 
font-family: serif, sans serif, monospace
by default is serif 
web safe font will able to render almost all platform
cssfontstack.com
is the place to know what font to choose from the all website

flaticon.com
giphy.com

Section5.53.css

CSS sizing
font-sizing 
if the user change the default font size for the page the font-sizing doesn't change because it's not dynamic 
don't use pixel use percantage 
16px = 100%
another way use em
16px = 100%  = 1em
font-sizing is add up from the parent for percentage and em so watchout, but for the pixel because is static sizing it's not adding up
but there is a way to use it with em is with rem (root em)
recomended using rem
use the box model with pixel it's more recommended
preffered way to use line height is only answer value with number only

Section5.58.css

CSS float and clear 
floating image
float: left
float is wrap around 
clear is the opposite of wrap around
only use float when it's necesary ( wrapping text around a certain element )

63. what is bootstrap

codeply like codepen but can add framework like bootstrap

64. how to install bottstrap 

cdn content delivery network ( is the submarine cable )
user already have a fromework cache

you can linked it in your local bootstrap.dist that you download 
and linked it to bootstrap.css
but lead to a little bit more latency

65. web design 101 wireframing

before you design a website you have to do wireframing 
low fedility ( simple )

the opposite of wireframing is mockup 
high fedility ( it's like exactly what you want to look )

awwwarrd.com 
ui-pattern.com ( example for the website )

simple sketch > mock up > prototype 
the inspiration is called dribbble.com

start to make wireframe
start to make it by pen and paper 
industry standard tool is balsamiq.cloud 

66. the bootstrap navigation bar

you can put another style outside the bootstrap just linked it to the css 

you have to see the guidline and the rule go to the bootstrap and go to document 

you go to buttons documentation to see color by using the word

ms-auto ( margin start auto )

when the display smaller navbar should be hambergur menu

70. bootstrap grid layout system 

the smaller device the image width and the font the size got bigger

layout using grid layout 
in bootstrap the total of a single row is 12 col

74. bootstrap containers

container to contain section 

75. bootstrap button & fontawesome 

fontawesome.com 
it's perfect for searching icon

commenting link i'ts importan

76. styling our website challenge solution

when you styling with bootstrap its good to make another class if you want to change a certain behavior and avoid changing the bootstrap value

78. solution to bootsrap challenge 1

you can use text-align center

80. the bootstrap carousel part 1

look at the bootstrap document in carousel and tab in on usage option to know how to change the setting 

bootsnip.com
for the snippet example 

82. cards

look at the card documentation and pricing example

83. the css z-index and stacking order

the z-index will not work if the box position is static. anything else is working. all the box must be positioned to effect one each other

the detail in pdf section6

84. Media Query Breakpoints

https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly
to check wether or not your website is mobile friendly

if the website is not mobile friendly the google ranking will drop so not showing in google search page 1. and no one see page 2 page 3

@media screen
@media speech
@media (max-width = 900px) (active when 900px lower) {
@media (min-width = 900px) ( active when 900px higher) its target di opposite way
@media (min-width = 900px) and (max-width = 900px)


when the screen get smaller the features must be bigger

87. how to become a better programmer - code refactoring

code refactoring
1. readability
2. modularity
how easy to narrow it down 
how eady to reuse 
3. efficiency
how fast can your code run
4. length
shorter doesn't usually good

code golf 
codegolf.stackexchange.com 
it's a challange to make code as short as possible

dry = don't repeat yourself 

88. refactoring our website part 1

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
 font-family = montserrat }

use class not element so modulairity is higher

padding usually goes to the container-fluid, so every section have container 

combined selector 
h1#title {}
.container.title ( class ="container title" )

section background color has class to dry the code

higher ranking 
id > classes > html element > inline css

id it's for section it's functional for navigation as well

avoid inline style at all cost

make a new habit to go after the existing habit 

95. introduction to a web design 

most important thing in the website is look beautifull and work as i intended to

you only have 3 seconds to make a good impression

good design look expensive and professional 

web design principles
color theory 
typography

geometric

script
personal cretive elegant

display
friendly loud amusing 

modern
stylish chic smart
exp didot for vogue mag
 
when you looking for legebility
open shapes
ample intercharacter spacing
unambiguous forms
varying proportions

2 font in 1 design 
look for 2 font with
similar mood 
similar time era
contrast serif-ness (1 font serif 1 font sans serif ) 
contrast weight

think about what you wanna convey with the type faces

98. manage attention with effective user interface (ui) design

1. hierarchy
color
very bright and muted color to know where to focus first
size 
big to small to know where to focus first 

2. layout 
length of text 45ch to 75ch

3. alighnment 
consistency is key for alignment text 

reduce the number of the alignment 
to look professional 

use grid line 

4. white space 
adding more space make more minimalist and professional 

5. audience
depend on the audience

as long as fit to the audience it's fine 

99. user experience (ux) design 

1. simplicity

mobile responsive is important 
don't have so many banner on the screen

5. don't use your powers for evil 

dark pattern. make user do something that user don't want 

100. web design in practice

JAVASCRIPT

101. introduction of javascript

brendan eich create javascript in 10days

europian computer manufactur script es ecma script 

javascript is interpreted programming language
java compiled programming language

javascript the one who browser most compatible 

102. javascript alert system - adding behaviours to a website

go to console to type some of javascript 
for ex alert("hello"); pop up will appear with hello text 

holding shift to go to the next line 

use inspect sources snippets new snippets and type code control enter to excecute

function("message");
no spaces 
single and double quotes are the same 
the programmer usually use to double quotes

github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js
priciples of writing consistent, idiomatic javascript

103. data types

data types
string is a data types 
numbers
boolean true or false

104. javascript variable

var myName = "angela";
keyword name = "value";

var stand for the word variable 

107. naming and naming convention for javascript variables

how to clear the command ctrl+k
how to clear the memory cache of the data in console > hold on reload and hard reload > ctrl + shift + R

always give your variable meaningfull name 

you can't name variable var 
you can't name variable 123 or number first 
you can't name variable with space my name
you can't name variable with dash -
you only can name the variable abs 123 $ _

alyas give variable name with camel chacing myName 

108. string concatenation 
109. string length and retrieving the number of characters

word.length

when you tabbed out from the prompt that existing and empty it will be null and it will be error

110. slicing and extracting part of string 

always start with zero 
a b c
0 1 2
name.slice(0,1);
a 
name.slice(4.9);
9 - 4 five character 

111.challenge : changing chasing in text

word.toUpperCase()

112.challenge : changing string casing solution

programmer skill taking a big problem chunking it down breaking it down to smaller pieces if still stuck in that smaller pieces chunking it down again 

113. basic arithmetic and the modulo operator in javascript 

()
*
/
+
-

% ( modulo )
var 2 = 9 % 6 >>> 3 ( the remainder of the number 9 divided by 6 ) 

prompt value is string but it can be used as number what???

114. increment and decrement expression 

var  = 5;
x = x + 1 or x++ // 6
x = x - 1 or  x-- // 4
x = x + 2 or x += 2 // 7
x = x + y or x += y // 5+y

its the same 
x *= 2
x /= 2
x -= 2
x += 2

x= 3;
y = x++;
y+=1; (3+1=4)

1. Post Increment (x++)
2. Pre Increment(++x)

After post incrementing y will have no relation with x so y will have the assigned value 3 and x will be incremented to 4

bisa dibilang hasilnya bercabang
y = x++

y = x and x = x + 1

jadi x digunakan 2 kali 

115. function part 1: creating and calling function 

function is grouping the series of codes and can be call by 1 code 

function getMilk() {  ...  }
how to call
getmilk();

console.log = it will log the value inside the console 

alert is the user can see
console.log is for the developer only

116. functions part 1 challenge - the karel robot 

stanford.edu/~cpiech/karel/ide.html

119. functions part 2 - parameters and arguments

function getMilk(input) {.....}

function getMilk (bottles) {
  var cost = bottles * 1.5;
}
how to call it 
getMilk(2);

120. function part 3 : output and returns value

function getMilk (money) {
   var changecash = money % 1.5 ;
   return changecash;
}
how to call it 
var change = getMilk(4);

125. random number generator in javascript: building a love calculator

 var n = Math.random();
the result is 16 decimal places number 
between 0 - 0.9999999999999999 > (9 nya ada 16 kali)

dice
var n = Math.random();
n = n * 6;
n = Math.floor(n);

function randomValue(min, max) {
    var randomVal= Math.floor(Math.random() * ((max - min) + 1)) + min;
    return randomVal;
}

random and pseudorandom generator its diferrent 

126. control statement: using if & else conditional and logic

using if & else >> control flow

if (track === "clear") {
    goStraight();
} else {
    turnRight();
}

127. comparator and equality

=== is equal to
!== is not equal to 
> is greater than
< is lesser than 
>= is greater or equal to 
<= is lesser or equal to 

the different between == and === is the === is also checking the data type are matching or not 
1 and "1" for == is the same but for === its different 

128. combining comparator 

&& and 
|| or 
! not 

it's important if you don't understand the logic make a flow chart out of it 

131. collection: working with javascript arrays

var eggs = [a,b,c,d,e,f]
                   0 1 2 3 4 5
how to call it 
var myEgg = eggs[1]; b
var myEgg = eggs.length; 5
eggs.includes(); the output is boolean

if comparator is boolean don't need to compare (=== true) just write
if (boolean) {}

132. adding element and intermediate array tecnique

codinghorror.com

eggs.push(); always push it at the end 
eggs.pop(); push out the last item in arrays

order in java script is matter

if you use a bunch of if and then else at the end the if else function that work is the last if and else. but if you use if else if and  else it will be 1 pair 

134. control statement: while loops

while (something is true) {
    //Do something
}

var i = 1;
while(i<2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

if while loop keep true it will be crash 

136. control statements. for loops

 for (var i=0; i<2; i++) {....}
        start end change

while is checking for a state 
( while player 1 is alive, repeatadly play the loop)

for is you trying to iterate
trying to run the code many many time with for loop define the count

140. adding javascript to a website

onload="alert('hello');" > when the element is loaded up

the quotation mark is has to be different " ' so it doesn't miss read which is the code which is the string

try to avoid inline javascript 

to use internal javascript use
<script type="text/javascript"> 

</script>

try to use external javascript 
<script src="index.js" charset="ust-8"> 

</script>

the javascript <script> text placement should be below before </body>
try to think the order of the style and script in the html
the html referencing the style.css
javascript refferencing the html > so when there is no reference in html javascript can't load

141. introduction to the document object model (DOM)

html tree generator extention

document is outside the html 

var heading = document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild; > in console
heading.innerHTML = "good bye"; > to change the value inside the html element 
heading.style.color = "red"; to change the properties of the html element 
document.querySelector("input").click(); > look inside the entire document for the object that has a selector of input >> method  .click(); > simulate the mouse click ( it will be clicking the input )

object inside the dom can have properties and method
object is the element 

properties exp
innerHTML
style
firstChild

methods
click()
appendchild()
setAttribute()


to get the value of the properties 
car.colours >> getter ( get property )

to set the value of the properties
car.numberOfDoors = 0; >> setting ( set the property )

method
car.drive(); >> call method

the different between method and function is 
method is something the object can do. so it should be associated with the object
car.drive()
object.method();

var third = document.querySelector("ul").lastElementChild;
third.innerHTML = "you";

143. Selecting HTML element with javascript

document.getElementsByTagName("li");
the elements is plural so the result is array of all list that exist in document 

property can't set in the array, but if you select the specific value of the array you can change the properties
document.getElementsByTagName("li")[2].style.color = "purple";
document.getElementsByTagName("li").length;

document.getElementsByClassName("list");
document.getElementsByClassName("list")[1].style.color = "green";

document.getElementById("heading")
document.getElementById("heading").innerHTML = "good bye";
it's not plural cause there is only 1 id for 1 html. 

document.querySelector("h1");
document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "sayorana";
document.querySelector("#heading").innerHTML = "sayor";
document.querySelector(".list").innerHTML = "sayor";
document.querySelector("li.list");
document.querySelector("#li a");
you can put an element, a class, or an id > the way it work it's to specify it like you do in CSS. if you get more than 1 element from querySelector you only select the first one.
if you want to get all the element you'll use querySelectorAll but because the output is array if you want to change it you have to specify the index
document.querySelectorAll("li");

remember that in CSS li.list is the same hirarki but li .list parent child hirariki

usually use querySelectorAll or querySelector

144. Manipulating and changing style of HTML element with Javascript 

javascript naming method and properties is using chamel case
the name from css is usually the same just use chamel case and no spacing 
you can find the naming for html dom style object documentation in w3schools.com
so changing value in javascript the value must be string 

145. the separation of concerns: structured vs style vs behavior 

html content only 
css to style
javascript to behavior

document.querySelector("button").classList.add("inv");
document.querySelector("button").classList.remove("inv");
document.querySelector("button").classList.toggle("inv");

146. text manipulation and text content property

the differrent between innerHTML and textContent is 
the innerHTML will change all the thing inside the element for exp 
inside p there is strong and content, the strong and content will be catch and can be change = "<em>good Bye</em>";

document.querySelector(".list1").innerHTML;
<strong>home</strong>
document.querySelector(".list1").textContent;
home

147. manipulating html element atribute

document.querySelector("a").attributes; > get the result and its plural
NamedNodeMap {0: href, href: href, length: 1}
document.querySelector("a").getAttribute("href"); >> get the result and its singular
'https://www.google.com'
document.querySelector("a").setAttribute("href", "https://www.bing.com"); >> set the upcoming value
